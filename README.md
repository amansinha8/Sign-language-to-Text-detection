# Sign Language to Text Detection
A deep learning-based project designed to translate sign language gestures into real-time text, empowering communication for the deaf and mute community.
🧠 Project Overview
This project leverages computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify hand gestures and convert them into readable text. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, it features webcam-based real-time inference and a user-friendly interface for live demonstrations.
🚀 Features
- Real-time gesture recognition via webcam
- CNN-based gesture classification
- Custom dataset training with data augmentation
- Intuitive notebook interface for live testing
🔧 Technologies Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV – Video capture & image preprocessing
- TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning model implementation
- Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and numerical operations
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization of model performance and training metrics
